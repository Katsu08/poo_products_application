A little practice of javascript oriented to objects

### Class

1. Product: It's the responsable of create products with a name, price, year and id, and their common methods
2. ProductList: It's the responsable of create a Array of Products (list), have the methods to add and remove products, too have methods to save and recovery the product list in the localstorage, but this can be improve adding an ID to each product list and saving multiples instances of products lists in the LocalStorage using the ID
3. UI: It's the responsable of control the DOM. Have static methods because it don't need to create a instance to work

### Colors

I have used bootswatch theme to change the colors, if you want personalize this u can search a Bootswatch theme, here: https://bootswatch.com/ . And change the CSS linked file with the URL theme you want

```HTML
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://bootswatch.com/5/quartz/bootstrap.min.css">
```

### How to do this practice?

I have follow this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqre9kKFRpc. I have used my self knowledges of Javascript POO to try improve this code. I will like too that this repository work to talk about good practices, ways to improve the code, and like a guide to who wants see a P.O.O Javascript code to learn too
