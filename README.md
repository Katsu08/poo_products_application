# POO Products Application

A little practice of javascript oriented to objects

### Class

1. Product: It's the responsable of create products with a name, price, year and id, and their common methods
2. ProductList: It's the responsable of create a Array of Products (list), have the methods to add and remove products, too have methods to save and recovery the product list in the localstorage, but this can be improve adding an ID to each product list and saving multiples instances of products lists in the LocalStorage using the ID
3. UI: It's the responsable of control the DOM. Have static methods because it don't need to create a instance to work

### How to do this practice?

I have follow this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqre9kKFRpc. I have added too some custom practices of Javascript POO that I have learned in other courses. I will like too that this repository work to talk about good practices, ways to improve the code, and like a guide to who wants see a P.O.O Javascript code to learn too
